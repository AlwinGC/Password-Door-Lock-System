# Password-Door-Lock-System

Password door lock system using Arduino.

The LCD will display a message asking the user to insert the password using the keypad " Enter Password". If the user enters the wrong key a warning will be shown in the LCD "Authorized Entry Only". The LED Strip turns on green when the password is correct and red when it is incorrect. Once the user enters the correct password the servo motor starts and the door unlocks.
